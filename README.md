# titanic

This is my first personal Kaggle competition! I attempted the classic Titanic prediction challenge by following some pre-existing methods, with a few minor tweaks of my own (including data imputation for missing values). 

I hope to retry this in the future using more advanced methodology, but this uses a random forest approach for ~77% accuracy. I'm sure I can get that higher with other methods.
